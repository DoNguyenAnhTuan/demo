The dataset includes 3108 images.
Esp8266-new3-13-Wemos-e-zero-mega-3B-3B--final-ESP32-STM32-Arduino-Esp32-33-new3-13-Wemos-e-zero-mega-3B-3B--final-ESP32-STM32-Arduino-Esp32-33-vI0n are annotated in Pascal VOC format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

No image augmentation techniques were applied.
